# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for building a customer churn prediction model. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers ceasing to do business with a company. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and maximize revenue. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is [dataset](dataset). This dataset contains information about customers, including demographic data, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following libraries installed:
- Python (version X.X.X)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- [any other libraries used]

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Customer_Churn_Prediction_Model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Customer_Churn_Prediction_Model
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```
   python customer_churn_prediction.py
   ```

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook or script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrix and ROC curve are used to assess the model's performance.

## Future Work
Future work may include:
- Feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Trying different machine learning algorithms.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
- Deployment of the model in a production environment.
